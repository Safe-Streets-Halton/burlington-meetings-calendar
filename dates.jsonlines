Our role in the community is to promote the principles and objectives of Sustainable Development and to advise and assist City staff and Council members on these issues. We do this by reviewing and commenting on land use policies and development applications, researching sustainable development issues and preparing position papers, and by participating in and hosting special sustainability events. The members of the Burlington Sustainable Development Advisory Committee are volunteer citizens who have been appointed by Council to advise on issues that relate to sustainable development. During the day, we are, or have been, architects, biologists, business people, developers, engineers, musicians, planners, stay-at-home parents, university students and more. Our common ground is our passion to minimize impacts on the environment and the belief that the City of Burlington is a great place to live, work and play.\nPlease note Advisory Committees are not webcasted.
