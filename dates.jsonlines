In 1984, a Mundialization Committee of volunteer citizens was formed in Burlington to pursue twinning with another country. A by-law was passed in 1985 to declare Burlington a \"World Community\" dedicated to international co-operation (mundialization) and that the City of Burlington, as part of its Mundialization program, proceed: (a) to undertake a twinning program with a municipality in another country, and (b) to fly the United Nations flag with the Canadian flag from City Hall at all times. On May 12, 1989, Mayor Bird signed a twinning agreement with Mayor Kurihara of Itabashi, Japan. On May 6, 2005, Mayor MacIsaac signed a twinning agreement with Mayor de Graaf of Apeldoorn, the Netherlands.
