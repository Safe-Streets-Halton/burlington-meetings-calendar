This is a Scrapy project
which scrapes the date-availability information for
[Burlington Ontario Committee Meetings](https://events.burlington.ca/meetings/Index)
and exports it as iCal.

If the iCal file is served over http,
it can be consumed as a refreshable Feed in Apple's Calendar.app
on iPhone or Mac.
