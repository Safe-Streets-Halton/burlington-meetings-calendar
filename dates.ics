 t of its Mundialization program\, proceed: (a) to undertake a twinning pro
 gram with a municipality in another country\, and (b) to fly the United Na
 tions flag with the Canadian flag from City Hall at all times. On May 12\,

  in 1985 to declare Burlington a "World Community" dedicated to internatio
 nal co-operation (mundialization) and that the City of Burlington\, as par
 t of its Mundialization program\, proceed: (a) to undertake a twinning pro
 gram with a municipality in another country\, and (b) to fly the United Na
 tions flag with the Canadian flag from City Hall at all times. On May 12\,
  1989\, Mayor Bird signed a twinning agreement with Mayor Kurihara of Itab
 ashi\, Japan. On May 6\, 2005\, Mayor MacIsaac signed a twinning agreement
  with Mayor de Graaf of Apeldoorn\, the Netherlands. For any additional in
