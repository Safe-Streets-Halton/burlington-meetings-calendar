 in Burlington to pursue twinning with another country. A by-law was passed
  in 1985 to declare Burlington a "World Community" dedicated to internatio
 nal co-operation (mundialization) and that the City of Burlington\, as par
 t of its Mundialization program\, proceed: (a) to undertake a twinning pro
 gram with a municipality in another country\, and (b) to fly the United Na
 tions flag with the Canadian flag from City Hall at all times. On May 12\,
  1989\, Mayor Bird signed a twinning agreement with Mayor Kurihara of Itab
 ashi\, Japan. On May 6\, 2005\, Mayor MacIsaac signed a twinning agreement
  with Mayor de Graaf of Apeldoorn\, the Netherlands. For any additional in
