In 1984, a Mundialization Committee of volunteer citizens was formed in Burlington to pursue twinning with another country. A by-law was passed in 1985 to declare Burlington a \"World Community\" dedicated to international co-operation (mundialization) and that the City of Burlington, as part of its Mundialization program, proceed: (a) to undertake a twinning program with a municipality in another country, and (b) to fly the United Nations flag with the Canadian flag from City Hall at all times. On May 12, 1989, Mayor Bird signed a twinning agreement with Mayor Kurihara of Itabashi, Japan. On May 6, 2005, Mayor MacIsaac signed a twinning agreement with Mayor de Graaf of Apeldoorn, the Netherlands.

The BAAC provides advice on the identification, removal and prevention of barriers to people with disabilities in the municipality's by-laws, policies, programs and services. The BAAC works in partnership with the City to create the Multi-Year Corporate Accessibility Plan and advises the City on accessibility issues, not only to help remove existing barriers but also to prevent new barriers from being created. It provides input to staff and Council about matters of accessibility. All site plans submitted to the City, including those of the private sector, are reviewed by the BAAC to make sure accessibility is considered before a building is constructed or modified. Members are available to speak to your organization about accessibility, welcoming people with disabilities into your workplace or business, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act and its regulations. The Committee is a requirement by law through the Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2001 and the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005.

On May 12, 1989, Mayor Bird signed a twinning agreement with Mayor Kurihara of Itabashi, Japan. On May 6, 2005, Mayor MacIsaac signed a twinning agreement with Mayor de Graaf of Apeldoorn, the Netherlands.
